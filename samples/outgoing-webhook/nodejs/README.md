# Outgoing Webhook Sample Node.js

## Summary

This project is an implementation of a very simple [Outgoing Webhook](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/custom-bot) for Microsoft Teams. All it does is verify that what's sending messages matches the Outgoing Webhook that was created in Teams, and it echoes back whatever is sent to it.

## Interaction with app

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account (not a guest account)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or equivalent tunnelling solution
- [M365 developer account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) or access to a Teams account with the appropriate permissions to install an app.
- [Teams Toolkit for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension) or [TeamsFx CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/teamsfx-cli?pivots=version-one)

## Run the app (Using Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code)

The simplest way to run this sample in Teams is to use Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code.

1. Ensure you have downloaded and installed [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)
1. Install the [Teams Toolkit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension)
1. Select **File > Open Folder** in VS Code and choose this samples directory from the repo
1. Using the extension, sign in with your Microsoft 365 account where you have permissions to upload custom apps
1. Select **Debug > Start Debugging** or **F5** to run the app in a Teams web client.
1. In the browser that launches, select the **Add** button to install the app to Teams.
> If you do not have permission to upload custom apps (sideloading), Teams Toolkit will recommend creating and using a Microsoft 365 Developer Program account - a free program to get your own dev environment sandbox that includes Teams.

## Setup

 
1. Create Webhook
  * Create the Outgoing Webhook in Teams using the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/custom-bot). Paste the tunneling service URL from the previous step into the "Callback URL" box. After you press the Create button, copy/paste the security token that Teams generates to the clipboard.

  * Paste the security token generated by Teams as the value of `sharedSecret` in `app.js`. When you're done, it should look something like this:

    ```javascript
    const sharedSecret = "+ZaRRMC8+mpnfGaGsBOmkIFt98bttL5YQRq3p2tXgcE=";  ```

  * In the directory in which you installed this project, type `node app.js`

  * In Microsoft Teams, in any channel in the team in which you created the Outgoing Webhook, you can type `@<botname> <card-type>` then it will respond back a card with specified card type.

    Supported <card type>: "adaptive-card", "hero-card", "list-card", "o365-card", "thumbnail-card"
    
 2. Setup NGROK
- Run ngrok - point to port 3978

```bash
# ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
```
3. Setup Code

- In a terminal, navigate to `samples/outgoing-webhook/nodejs`

 - Install modules

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    
 - Install modules

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
- Run your bot at the command line:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Running the sample

- Example screenshot to show Hero card:
![Hero card](Images/heroCard.png)

* Supported <card type>: "adaptive-card", "hero-card", "list-card", "o365-card", "thumbnail-card"

* If you type anything else apart from above mentioned type, it will echo back what you typed.
